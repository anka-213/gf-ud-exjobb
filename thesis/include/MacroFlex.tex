\section{Explanation of the macro system}

% What are the limitations without macros?
% Most importantly: syncats. gf-ud assumes that every word is in a leaf, represented by a lexical gf-function. however, syncategorimatic words \todo{define?} (or functions?) come from the functions that are used to combine trees (what are those called?) and would be missing otherwise. E.g. "is" is syncategorimatic in gf for english, because there is no lexical function for copula, because not all languages use a word for copula. So we make up a lexical gf-function for "is", which is then combined with a made-up version of MkCl which is converted into the thing we need.
% This is terrible writing!

In order to overcome some limitations of the conversion from UD to GF, especially the issue with multiple possible matching trees mentioned in \autoref{sec:multiple_trees}, there is a system of macros. A macro is an imaginary GF function that will get converted into an expression of real GF functions after the main conversion step of gf2ud is done.

% Syncats?
% \todo[inline]{Talk about syncategorematic words}

When one GF function corresponds to multiple different dependency labels, a macro can be used to disambiguate which one is meant and to avoid losing the information of that distinction.

One common case when macros are needed are so-called \emph{syncategorematic} words, that are associated with non-lexical functions\footnote{A lexical function is a function that takes zero arguments, which means that it will be in a leaf of the tree.}. For example, in GF, the copula is syncategorematic, which means that a copula cannot be parsed on its own using GF.

The following is an example from \cite{kolachina-ranta-2017} that uses macros to handle the syncategorematic nature of copulas:

\todo[inline]{Include some of the commented out content}

% We noted in Section 2 that ud2gf has to deal with
% ambiguity, incompleteness, noise, and ungrammaticality. The basic algorithm of Section 3 takes
% none of these aspects into account. But it does
% contain what is needed for ambiguity: the list ts
% of previous trees at each node can also be used
% more generally for storing alternative trees. The
% “main” tree t is then compared and ranked together with these candidates. Ranking based on
% tree probabilities in previous GF treebanks, as in
% (Angelov, 2011), is readily available. But an even
% more important criterion is the node coverage of
% the tree. This means penalizing heavily those trees
% that don’t cover all nodes in the subtrees.
% This leads us to the problem of incompleteness:
% what happens if the application of all possible candidate functions and trees still does not lead to a
% tree covering all nodes? An important part of this
% problem is due to syncategorematic words. For
% instance, the copula in GF is usually introduced as
% a part of the linearization, and does not have a category or function of its own.6 To take the simplest
% possible example, consider the adjectival predication function and its linearization:
% fun UseAP : AP -> VP
% lin UseAP ap = \\agr => be agr ++ ap
% where the agreement feature of the verb phrase is
% passed to an auxiliary function be, which produces
% the correct form of the copula when the subject
% is added. The sentence the cat is black has the
% following tree obtained from UD:





\begin{verbatim}
#auxfun MkVPS_Perf have vp : Have -> VP -> VPS = MkVPS (TTAnt AAnter 
  TPres) PPos vp ; aux[Tense=Pres] head
\end{verbatim}

The full syntax of macros can be found in \autoref{app:annotation}.

\section{Intro to macros}

% Motivate need for auxfuns and auxcats

GF trees are on a higher abstraction level than UD trees. In UD, every token is associated with a dependency label. In contrast, any production rule in a GF grammar may introduce new tokens. This difference complicates the mapping between the two formalisms.

When introducing the problem and its partial solution, \cite{kolachina-ranta-2017} name as examples copulas, negations, tense auxiliaries and infinitive marks. We reproduce their example of the English copula (the verb “to be”) and its treatment in \verb|ud2gf|.

Figures \ref{fig:gf_cute} and \ref{fig:ud_cute} show the difference between GF’s and UD’s treatment of copulas. In the UD tree, the copula has a category and a dependency label \verb|cop|. In the GF tree, there is no special category: the string “is” is introduced by the function \verb|UseComp : AP -> VP| rule, which makes an AP into a predicate.

\end{figure}

As a solution, \verb|ud2gf| introduced the notion of \emph{auxiliary categories} and \emph{auxiliary functions} in the labels file. This consists of the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Auxiliary category for copula: \verb|Cop_ VERB lemma=be|
    \item Auxiliary function that recognises the auxiliary category: \\
           \verb|UseAP_ : Cop_ -> AP -> VP ; cop head|
    \item Rule to replace the auxiliary function with an actual GF function: \\
          \verb|UseAP_ cop ap = UseAP ap|
\end{itemize}

However, coordination was still a problem in \verb|ud2gf|. The auxiliary categories and functions were not expressive enough to transform a structure like ``the small, cute and fluffy cat'' from UD to GF.





\section{Intro to flexibility problem}

As an example of a phrase that can be difficult to convert using the old ud2gf, let us consider the adjectival phrase ``cute, fluffy and furry''
would be described in UD format as in Figures \ref{fig:ud_cute_text} and \ref{fig:ud_cute}.


\begin{figure}
    \begin{verbatim}

    \caption{The phrase ``cute, fluffy and furry'' as a GF tree in graphical format. }
    \label{fig:gf_cute}
\end{figure}

The GF version of the same tree, shown in Figure \ref{fig:gf_cute}, would look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
ConjAP and_Conj (ConsAP (PositA cute_A)
                        (BaseAP (PositA fluffy_A) (PositA furry_A)))
\end{verbatim}
Here we can see that in UD, the word ``cute'' is in the root, while the conjunction ``and'' is at the bottom of the tree, while in GF the conjunction is a direct child of the root. This transformation can not be preformed by the simple single-layer transformations that are available in the current macro-system for labels files.

The main issue that made it impossible for the old macros to perform this transformation is that we need to extract several pieces of information from a node and then use them independently 

\section{Solution: Recursive macros}

% Most of the time the structure in UD trees are similar enough to allow a fairly direct translation.
% There are however some difficult cases where the structure is significantly different in a way that was impossible to overcome using the old macro system.
% 
% One such example is when you have a series of conjunctions, for example the phrase:
% 
% 
%   small, fluffy, furry and cute
% 
% In 

In order to improve the ability to create structurally different trees when converting from UD to GF, the ability for macros to be recursive was added. This means that when a macro is substituted, the resulting head is checked again to see if the result is another macro, until no more substitutions are possible. This makes it possible to encode data using Church-encoding, in particular the church encoding for pairs: a higher order function that takes a binary function as an argument and provides the two items it contains to the inner function.

\begin{verbatim}
type Pair a b = forall c. (a -> b -> c) -> c
\end{verbatim}

In order to construct and consume these pairs we use the following helper functions
\begin{lstlisting}
-- ab2r = a -> b -> r
-- Pair_a_b = ab2r -> r
#auxfun MkPair_ a b handler : a -> b -> ab2r -> r = handler a b ; head dummy dummy
#auxfun UsePair_ handler pair : ab2r -> Pair_a_b -> r = pair handler ; head dummy
\end{lstlisting}

When using these helpers, you would partially apply the \verb|MkPair_| helper, so it can later get the final \verb|handler| argument from \verb|UsePair_|.

\begin{lstlisting}
#auxfun AndCuteCont_ and cute : Conj -> AP -> Pair_Conj_AP = MkPair_ and cute ; cc head
\end{lstlisting}

The full implementation of conjunctions using recursive macros can be seen in \autoref{appendix:conjunctions}.

\section{Limitations and ideas for further improvements}

A more structured implementation of this could be to add (anonymous) records as well as pattern matching to the syntax of macros similar to the concrete syntax of GF. 

It could also be useful to have a more direct approach for describing the structural changes, especially since macros are only available in the \texttt{ud2gf} direction, not in the \texttt{gf2ud} direction.
